## motorcycle Voltage Indicator

The stator coils have burned on my bike recently. 
It has no voltage indicator installed so I've started to look for a problem only when the battery was depleted twice.

The idea is to have green light between 12.5V and 15V and a warning lights otherwise.

Can be used on any other vechle that requires small control light for the battery.

### Schema
I've used the [Допълнение 1 schema](http://www.kn34pc.com/construct/kolo_hristov_av_rgb.html) as the most simple one (do not care about the current)
